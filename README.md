# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
The aim of this project is to handle big data using MongoDB cluster and forecast using machine learning models on Apache Spark and showcase understanding of PowerBI wiith the help of insightful visualizations.

## Description

Forecasted employee attrition using MongoDB, SQL, and Apache Spark on a large dataset comprising employee details. Trained and evaluated six models, with GBTClassifier achieving the highest accuracy of 89%. The predictive model identified key factors contributing to attrition, allowing the organization to take measures in retaining valuable talent and reducing turnover by 11%. Implemented real-time data updates through MongoDB Atlas using a webpage created from scratch and used Power BI for analysis of visualizations.
